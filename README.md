# The SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines for developers to write scalable and maintainable code, introduced by Robert C. Martin in the early 2000s.



Here, SOLID is an acronym for:

* **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
* **O**pen-Closed Principle
* **L**iskov Substitution Principle
* **I**nterface Segregation Principle
* **D**ependency Inversion Principle



We will look into these one by one, first some text about the principle followed by the example code. I will try to provide good and bad code examples for each.
